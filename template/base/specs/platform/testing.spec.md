# Testing and Delivery Specification

Tests use fakes rather than mocks and validate behavior through ports. Every auth
boundary covers missing, invalid, expired, wrong-issuer, wrong-audience,
cross-user, dependency-failure, and legitimate cases where applicable.

Pre-commit and CI run Go formatting and tests, structural checks, OpenAPI/client
drift checks, TypeScript checks, and production builds. Dependencies, CI actions,
toolchains, and images are pinned. Generated projects must pass checks immediately
after bootstrap without manual source edits.
